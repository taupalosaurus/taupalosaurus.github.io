               Anisotropic metric based mesh adaptation has proved its efficiency to reduce the CPU time of 
               steady simulations while improving their accuracy. However its extension to time-dependent 
               problems is far from straightforward, and the introduction of moving meshes adds new problems. 
               This paper presents updates regarding mesh adaptation for unsteady problems with moving boundaries. 
               A new space-time analysis of the interpolation error in the continuous mesh framework is proposed, 
               which enables enhancements of the fixed- point unsteady mesh adaptation algorithm. The analysis is 
               then extended to the case of moving geometries, within the range of body-fitted moving meshes and 
               ALE simulations, and the appropriate modifications are made to the adaptation algorithm. Finally, 
               three dimensional adaptative simulations with moving boundaries are exhibited to validate our 
               approach.

               Three-dimensional real-life simulations are generally unsteady and involve moving geometries. 
               Industry is currently very far from performing such body-fitted simulations on a daily basis, 
               mainly due to the robustness of the moving mesh algorithm and their extensive computational 
               cost. A moving mesh algorithm coupled to local mesh optimizations has proved its efficiency 
               in dealing with large deformation of the mesh without re-meshing. In this paper, the coupling 
               of this algorithm with two mesh deformation techniques is studied: an elasticity PDE-based one 
               and an explicit Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation one, and both techniques are compared. 
               The efficiency of this method is demonstrated on challenging test cases, involving large body 
               deformations, boundary layers and large displacements with shearing. Finally, the moving mesh 
               algorithm is coupled to a CFD flow solver.

               This paper deals with numerical simulations involving three-dimensional moving 
               geometries with large displacements. Such simulations are much valued by industries, 
               but remain very time-consuming. A robust moving mesh algorithm coupling an elasticity-like 
               mesh deformation solution and mesh optimizations is proposed, that allows to avoid 
               remeshing while performing large displacements. However, this is done at the cost of 
               relaxing the fixed-topology constraint imposed by the classical 
               Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework. An ALE compressible flow solver is 
               integrated to this process. This solver lies on the strict interpretation of the 
               Discrete Geometrical Conservation Law to preserve the order of accuracy of the time 
               integration. For fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, the 
               six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) approach for rigid bodies is considered. Finally, 
               3D imposed-motion and FSI examples are given, to validate the proposed approach.

               Numerical simulation is currently broadly used in the world of engineering. Computation power and time 
               remain one of the main problematics, that limitate the scope of the simulations. Mesh adaptation aims 
               at answering this problem, thanks to a hudge increase of the precision of a com- putation, for a fixed 
               number of mesh vertices. Mesh adaptation for steady problems has become mature, however mesh adapation 
               for unsteady flows remains a challenge, from a theoretical point of view as well as practical. The 
               objective of this internship was the analysis of several variants of the unsteady mesh adaptation 
               algorithm designed in the Gamma team, at INRIA. This algorithm is based on the splitting of a simulation 
               interval into several sub-intervals, on which the solution does not evolve "too much", so that the same 
               adapted mesh can be considered on each sub-interval. The metric field, on which the generation of the 
               adapted meshes is based, is computed as an average of the instant metric fields along the sub-interval. 
               We have studied the several state-of-the art variants of the algorithm, re-doing the calculations that 
               lead to them. Then we have numerically compared two of these versions, in which the average metric fields 
               are computed differently, running a lot of simulations a several reprensentative test cases. We have 
               concluded that the l1 provides better results.
               In parallel to this work, we have carried out a pre-study on the moving mesh of an engine, for the INP 
               Énergies Nouvelles. We have prepared a mesh IFP had transmitted to us, and validated the movement of its 
               surface.
               We also have carried on the implementatio on GPU of our home CFD solver. We have improved our previous 
               implementation, and multiplied our acceleration factor by 5.
